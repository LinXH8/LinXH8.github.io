# My Cycling Hobby

I have a deep passion for cycling, which serves as the perfect escape from my rigorous studies in Applied Artificial Intelligence. Cycling not only keeps me physically active but also allows me to explore new places and enjoy a sense of freedom on the open road.

## The Joy of Riding

My bike of choice is the **Specialized Tarmac Pro**, equipped with a robust 35mm wide Wheel Angel wheelset. This setup is ideal for the long rides I often take to Malaysia, specifically to the picturesque regions of Kukup and Kulai. These destinations offer a mix of challenging routes and stunning scenery that make each trip worthwhile.

## Experiences and Benefits

Cycling has provided numerous benefits: enhanced physical fitness, mental clarity, and the joy of connecting with fellow cycling enthusiasts. It has become an integral part of my life where I find motivation and inspiration. Each ride is a new adventure, whether navigating the bustling roads or experiencing the quiet of rural landscapes.

## Routine and Goals

I ride several times a week, with longer rides planned for weekends. This not only helps maintain my fitness but also prepares me for future cycling events. One of my short-term goals is to complete a century ride, a challenge I am eagerly preparing for.

## Future Aspirations

Looking forward, I aim to integrate my knowledge of artificial intelligence with my passion for cycling to develop innovations that enhance safety and enjoyment for cyclists. By leveraging AI, I hope to create solutions that make cycling routes smarter and rides more enjoyable for the cycling community.

Thank you for reading about my cycling journey. I look forward to the many roads yet to be traveled and the stories yet to be told.
